## Why Simon may be different.

1. I love learning. I mean I **enjoy** learning with *passion*.
2. Unless I see any activity I get started with to the very __end__ :white_check_mark:, I don't stop trying to finish it off :relieved:.
3. _If you meet me on the road talking to myself_, know that I am struggling to finish a challenge I started.
4. Life is a box of __challenges__ for me. *I see every thing as a challenge that must be overcome, even eating my favourite meal* :grinning:.
